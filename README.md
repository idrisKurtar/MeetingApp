I developed Meeting app with ASP.net MVC. My project contains the fallowing features:

1- My website's homepage features a greeting tailored to the current time and displays the number of participants

2- I have created an application registration form for participation in the meeting, and I have utilized the Form validation feature. 

3- After registering for the course and indicating your attendance, you can view the list of other participants

4- You can view the details of other participants from the participant details page.
